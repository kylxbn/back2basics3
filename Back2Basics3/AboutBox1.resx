    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Wow. This program has a really long history. Anyway...

This program started out as "Back2Basics" (or B2B for short), an Ether program for the Alchemy OS (which is a virtual machine for the J2ME mobile platform)
that I made sometime around February 2013. I wondered, "How would this image looked like if the C64 was showing it?"
So I learned about color matching and dithering algorithms and stuff. It was sort of successful. Well, it did not consider the one fixed color of every tile in a real C64, nor did it consider the limited
number of tiles that the memory can handle, nor did it consider the resolution
of the targetted computer, or even the fact that the hi-color C64 mode had a wide pixel ratio, but it did create "believable" results since it limited the colors to four (or was it three) per
8x8 tile. Later, NES and ZX Spectrum modes were added,
but because it was running on a 330MHz ARM Nokia N95, it started to run really slowly, and the code got really messy (since I was only using a single source code file).
In the end, I regretted doing it all ("What a waste of code!", I thought) and deleted the executable from the net and the source code on my phone. (I later found out that there was still a copy of the
source code that I still haven't deleted, and I kept it for historical purpose, but that's another story.) I made a new program from scratch, for Alchemy OS, called "Indexed", with the aim of converting images into indexed format
(and in later versions, image analysis). It was fast since I wrote it carefully, but as before--is pretty much useless.

After I bought my first desktop computer (running Windows XP), I started programming in Java. I reimplemented it in Java, named "Back2Basics2". It now resizes the image to consider the target computer's screen resolution, and even
keeps track of that one fixed tile color in a hi-res C64 image. It also observes the wide pixel ratio
of the C64 in hi-color mode. It was also the first version to use LAB color space for color matching (previous versions used RGB color space) resulting in better conversions.
However, it still doesn't consider the tile count limitation, and ignores that completely. Not to mention that it ran really slowly because color space conversion was a lot of math, and it was written in Java, and I only had
a Pentium IV 3GHz as a CPU, and 512MB DDR RAM... Yeah...

Then when I bought my first laptop (now running Windows 10), I started programming in C#, and the sudden urge to revive my old program in C# gave birth to Back2Basics3. This contains all the previous features
and more. It can now reduce the tile count! This routine took me some time to make--with the help of TaW from Stack Overflow. Thanks, TaW! :)

Well... There!</value>
